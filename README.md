This section visualizes decision boundary and decision probabilities for each classifier fitted 
in the [previous section](link).  All the classifiers are comparable in terms of their performance, with the 
Random Forest Classifier achieving the maximum accuracy score of 0.94 for the test data.

The plot of the target as a function of the two principal components for the training data is shown below:



Next we plot decision boundary and decision probabilities for each classifier:
